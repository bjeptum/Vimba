# Vimba – AI-Powered Pay-Per-Task SACCO Alternative

## Project Title & Description
**Vimba** is an **AI-driven, task-based savings and microfinance platform** designed for the Kenyan gig economy.  

In traditional SACCOs (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations), contributions are monthly, manual, and slow to rotate. Vimba reimagines this system by making contributions automatic, digital, and tied to gig work income.  

**Who it’s for:**  
  Gig workers, boda riders, freelancers, and casual workers in Kenya who often struggle with irregular income but want to save consistently.  

**Why it matters:**  
  SACCOs and chamas (rotating savings groups) are widely trusted but lack real-time automation. Vimba provides:

  - **Task-based saving:** A small % is saved automatically per gig/task/payment.  
  - **Smart goals:** AI helps users save for specific targets (e.g., school fees, spare parts, rent).  
  - **Pooling & rotation:** Smart contracts rotate pooled savings fairly, like a chama, but without manual handling.  
  - **Financial empowerment:** Encourages a culture of micro-saving in real-time, reducing financial exclusion.  

## Tech Stack

### Core Development
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TailwindCSS for UI, Shadcn UI components.  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express / Next.js API routes.  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + authentication).  
- **Smart Contracts (MVP optional):** Solidity on Ethereum testnet (or Celo for mobile-first African adoption).  

### AI & Automation
- **AI Assistant:** ChatGPT (for scaffolding, docs, and testing support).  
- **Code Review:** CodeRabbit (integrated with GitHub).  

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend), Supabase (backend & DB).  
- **Payments Integration:** M-Pesa API (Safaricom Daraja API).  
- **Version Control:** GitHub.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.

## AI Integration Strategy

AI will be a co-pilot throughout the lifecycle of Vimba, not just a coding assistant.  

### 1. Code Generation
- Use **ChatGPT prompts** to scaffold new features, e.g., generating Next.js components, Supabase queries, or Solidity contract templates.  
- Provide **file tree or context** when asking AI for updates, so generated code integrates seamlessly.  
- Rely on **AI pair programming** to draft boilerplate and repetitive code, freeing time for core business logic.  

### 2. Testing
- Use AI to generate **unit tests** (Jest for frontend, Vitest/Playwright for integration).  
- Example workflow:  
  - Write core function → Prompt ChatGPT to generate test cases.  
  - Run tests → Debug with AI suggestions.  
- Encourage **test-driven development** (TDD-lite) with AI-generated test stubs before writing actual features.  

### 3. Documentation
- Maintain docstrings in **TypeScript functions** using AI (auto-generate explanations for params/returns).  
- Use ChatGPT to **refactor inline comments** into professional technical writing.  
- Regularly regenerate and refine **README.md** and API docs with AI assistance.  

### 4. Context-Aware AI Workflows
- When updating features, feed AI:  
  - **API specs** (Supabase schema, M-Pesa API docs).  
  - **File tree snippets** (so it knows project structure).  
  - **Git diffs** (to generate migration or refactoring suggestions).  
- For **code reviews**, CodeRabbit ensures consistency and best practices, while ChatGPT provides context-aware refactoring advice.  


##  Project Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Define project scope & features.  
- Set up GitHub repo with README.md and project board.  
- Scaffold Next.js + Supabase authentication.  

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement **user onboarding** (email/password login via Supabase).  
- Integrate **M-Pesa API** for micro-deposits/withdrawals.  
- Build **task-based saving logic** (save X% per transaction).  
- Implement **goal tracking UI** (school fees, spare parts, etc.).  

### Phase 3: Smart Contracts & Pooling
- Draft Solidity smart contract for **rotating pooled savings**.  
- Deploy to **Celo Alfajores testnet**.  
- Integrate with frontend to show pool rotation.  

### Phase 4: AI Enhancements
- AI-powered **saving suggestions** (how much to save based on transaction history).  
- Smart nudges/notifications (“You’re KES 200 away from your goal!”).  

### Phase 5: Polish & Launch
- Add **analytics dashboard** for user savings.  
- Finalize **tests, docs, and code reviews** with AI support.  
- Deploy MVP to Vercel + Supabase.
